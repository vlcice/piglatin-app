# Pig Latin

So this is my implementation of a Pig Latin translator. 
I have decided to make it as a package 

```
https://packagist.org/packages/vlcice/piglatin
```

and here is the very simple front-end app:


```
git clone https://github.com/vlcice/piglatin-app
composer install
```  

Well, it is not perfect, and there could be many improvements, such as autocomplete using dictionary words, 
or java script validation before submiting form or ajax update. But I have prefered to do it as simple 
as possible.
